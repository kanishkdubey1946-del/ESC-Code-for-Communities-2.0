# Feature Tickets Document - ESC

## 1. Context

To build ESC systematically from scratch, the development roadmap must be decomposed into granular, self-contained feature tickets. Each ticket serves as an independent, buildable unit of work that ensures code logic remains cohesive and testable. Defining clear dependencies and specific instructions prevents architectural drift and simplifies implementation for developer agents.

---

## 2. Objective

The objective of this document is to map out the exact development tickets needed to implement the ESC platform from the baseline up. Each ticket details its requirements, priority, complexity, verification notes, dependencies, and contains a comprehensive implementation prompt. This allows developers or AI subagents to tackle tickets sequentially with clear direction and zero ambiguity.

---

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- **Granular Feature Breakdown**: 14 developer tickets spanning backend environment setup, auth integration, agent coding (ADK), orchestration routing (SSE), React layout creation, real-time sync, refinement chat, and exporting.
- **Priority and Complexity Estimates**: Quantified using standard priority levels and story points.
- **Dependency Flow**: A clear path showing which backend tasks must complete before frontend views are implemented.

### Out of Scope
- **Sprint Scheduling & Assignee Allocation**: Project management metrics outside system requirements.
- **Continuous Integration Pipeline Construction**: Creating the specific yaml tasks (these are noted in architecture but do not need separate feature tickets for application MVP execution).

---

## 4. Detailed Explanation & Individual Tickets

### Ticket 1: Backend Environment & Base Config Setup
- **Feature**: Backend Infrastructure Setup
- **Description**: Configure the base FastAPI application structure with environment variables loaded through Pydantic `BaseSettings`. Include a health check route (`/health`) and structured logging middleware.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. Running the FastAPI server locally starts on port `8000`.
  2. Navigating to `http://localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}` with a `200 OK` code.
  3. All configurations load from an `.env` file; missing variables trigger a startup crash with descriptive error logs.
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Complexity**: 2 Story Points
- **Testing Notes**: Run `pytest` on `/health` endpoint. Verify that `.env` loading crashes if mandatory keys are missing.
- **Implementation Prompt**:
  ```text
  Set up a FastAPI project inside the "backend" directory. Configure app/main.py with a GET "/health" endpoint returning a health status dictionary. Implement app/core/config.py using pydantic-settings to load database URLs, Firebase credentials path, and GEMINI_API_KEY from environment variables. Set up structured JSON logging in app/core/logging.py.
  ```

### Ticket 2: User Authentication & Auth Middleware
- **Feature**: Backend Auth Security
- **Description**: Build a FastAPI security dependency using the `firebase-admin` SDK. Parse the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, verify the JWT signature, check expiration, and retrieve the user's `uid` and `email`.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. Requests without headers or with malformed headers return `401 Unauthorized`.
  2. Requests with expired or invalid signatures return `401 Unauthorized`.
  3. Requests with valid tokens decode successfully and pass the user context to the route handler.
- **Dependencies**: Ticket 1
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Complexity**: 3 Story Points
- **Testing Notes**: Mock Firebase SDK token verification in tests to simulate valid, expired, and corrupt keys.
- **Implementation Prompt**:

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (System Level)

To declare the ESC platform implementation fully complete:
1. **End-to-End Orchestration**: A user inputting a business idea must trigger a sequential execution pipeline of all 5 agents (Research -> Strategy -> Pitch/Dev/Content) and receive outputs within 5 minutes.
2. **Context Integrity**: The output of preceding agents must validate against structural schemas and be consumed in subsequent agent prompts.
3. **No Cross-User Context Leaks**: Multi-tenant database separation must prevent reading/writing to other users' workspaces.
4. **Fluid Frontend Updates**: The frontend console must update state incrementally without freezing during streaming sessions.

---

## 8. Future Improvements

- Add support for parallel branching agent execution to reduce the total orchestration duration.
- Implement Git integration allowing the Development Agent to push code snippets directly to GitHub.

---

## 9. Risks

- **FastAPI SSE Connection Dropouts**: Unstable network connections may interrupt streaming.
  * *Mitigation*: Enable automatic client reconnection handlers in EventSource with automatic stream position caching.
- **Gemini Out-of-Tokens Errors**: Large output context loops may trigger API blockages.
  * *Mitigation*: Run compression summarizing operations on output payloads prior to feeding them to next agent steps.

---

## 10. Notes

- Developers should run backend server and frontend client concurrently using separate terminal shells.
- All Firebase emulator configs must be verified in the development stage prior to deploying to the cloud.

---

## 11. AI Implementation Instructions

All coding AI agents implementing these tickets must strictly follow these constraints:
- **No Mock-Ups**: Code files must include full functions, dependencies, and validations. Never use inline comment placeholders like `# Todo: Implement logic here`.
- **Typing Strictness**: Code Python variables using explicit types, and build React components with explicit prop validations.

---
