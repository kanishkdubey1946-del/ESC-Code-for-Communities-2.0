ESC — Enhanced Study Companion

Adaptive learning, specialist AI agents, and multi-agent workflows in one workspace.

Built with React + TypeScript + FastAPI + SQLite, with optional AI routing through Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, or OpenRouter.

</div>

Overview

ESC (Enhanced Study Companion) is an AI-powered workspace designed to do more than answer isolated prompts. It combines a persistent adaptive-learning system with specialist AI agents and structured research/business workflows.

The core student experience closes the learning loop:

Profile & goal
   ↓
Diagnostic quiz
   ↓
Server-side scoring
   ↓
Topic mastery analysis
   ↓
Diagnosis
   ↓
Personalized study plan + resources
   ↓
Task completion / re-test
   ↓
Updated mastery + new plan version

The application also includes a broader multi-agent workspace with Business, Student, and Playground modes, allowing users to launch specialized agents for research, strategy, planning, explanations, quizzes, flashcards, mind maps, resource discovery, development planning, and more.

The active learning specialists are implemented as a Google ADK team: 12 independent specialist agents plus an ESC Learning Orchestrator that delegates requests, with persistent database-backed ADK sessions and guarded, owner-scoped tools. See `docs/ADK_AGENT_TEAM.md`.

Adaptive Learning Data Flow

Authenticated user
  → profile / learning sources
  → safe quiz payload
  → server-side attempt submission
  → per-topic results
  → mastery calculation
  → diagnosis
  → study plan + matched resources
  → task completion
  → future re-test

The browser never receives the stored answer key before a quiz is submitted.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Install:

Node.js 20+

Python 3.11+

npm

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ESC-main

API Overview

Authentication

POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
GET  /api/auth/me
POST /api/auth/logout

Research & Agents

GET   /profile
PUT   /profile
GET   /memory
POST  /sources
GET   /sources
POST  /sources/upload
POST  /quizzes/generate

Adaptive Mastery Logic

ESC uses deterministic scoring for objective quiz results.

Topic Accuracy

accuracy = correct answers / graded answers × 100

Mastery Update

For a learner's first result:

mastery = latest topic accuracy

For later attempts:

new mastery = 0.40 × previous mastery + 0.60 × latest topic accuracy

Confidence

confidence = min(1.0, cumulative graded questions / 10)

Topic Status

Condition

Status

Fewer than 3 graded questions

insufficient_evidence

Mastery < 65

weak

Mastery < 80

developing

Mastery ≥ 80

strong

A trend change of approximately ±10 percentage points is used to identify meaningful improvement or decline.

Demo Flow

A simple way to demonstrate ESC:

Register a user.

Complete the student profile.

Add a deadline and daily available study time.

Upload notes or add learning material.

Generate a diagnostic quiz for a topic.

Submit weak or incomplete answers.

Review mastery, diagnosis, resources, and generated study plan.

Complete one or more plan tasks.

Re-test the same topic with improved answers.

Compare the updated mastery and new study-plan version.

Sign out and back in to confirm that learning memory persists.

Seeded Demo Accounts

From backend/, run:

python scripts/seed_esc_demo.py

On Windows you can use:

py -3 scripts/seed_esc_demo.py

The script creates contrasting learner histories for demonstration purposes.

See docs/ESC_DEMO.md for the guided demo script.

Development Commands

Backend Tests

cd backend
pytest -q

Windows:

cd backend
py -3 -m pytest -q

Frontend Build

cd frontend
npm run build

Frontend Lint

npm run lint

Frontend Preview

npm run preview

Security Design

ESC keeps several important boundaries on the backend:

Learning data is scoped to the authenticated owner.

/api/v1/me endpoints derive student identity from authentication rather than trusting a client-supplied student ID.

Quiz answer keys are stored server-side and are not serialized in the pre-submission quiz payload.

Objective answers are graded server-side.

Database access uses owner-scoped persistence logic.

Provider API keys remain backend-only.

Uploaded source extraction is restricted by supported types and backend validation.

CORS origins can be explicitly configured for deployment.

Current Limitations

AI quality depends on the configured provider and model.

Without an AI provider, ESC can use clearly labeled fallback practice content instead of pretending generated questions are official previous-year questions.

External resources are not fetched on every learning interaction.

Some root-level COMET planning documents describe earlier architecture ideas and may not exactly match the current SQLite-based implementation. For implementation details, prefer the files under docs/ESC_* and the current source code.

Documentation

Useful project documents:

docs/ESC_ARCHITECTURE.md — implemented ESC architecture

docs/ESC_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md — implementation status and verification commands

docs/ESC_DEMO.md — guided demonstration flow

PRD.md — original product requirements / COMET concept

TechnicalArchitecture.md — original architecture design document

FrontendSpecification.md — frontend specification

Future Improvements

Possible next steps for the project include:

Cloud-hosted persistent database

OAuth / social authentication

Teacher dashboards and classroom analytics

Richer spaced-repetition scheduling

More advanced learner knowledge graphs

Real-time collaborative sessions

Automated deployment pipeline

Broader source connectors

Production observability and analytics

Mobile/PWA experience

Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

A typical contribution workflow:

git checkout -b feature/your-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add your feature"
git push origin feature/your-feature

Then open a pull request with a clear description of the change and how it was tested.
